# Privacy Policy for QR Code Scanner

**Date: August 16, 2025**

## Who We Are

This QR Code Scanner app is developed and maintained by Sonu Studios. You can contact us by downloading app in setting page for any questions regarding this privacy policy.

## Our Commitment to Your Privacy

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how our QR Code Scanner app handles your information and data.

## Information We DO NOT Collect

QR Code Scanner is designed with privacy in mind. We want to be completely transparent about what we do and do not collect:

- **No Personal Information**: We do not collect any personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, or location data.
- **No Usage Data**: We do not track how you use the app, what QR codes you scan, or when you use the app.
- **No Device Information**: We do not collect device identifiers, IP addresses, or any technical information about your device.
- **No Analytics**: We do not use any analytics services that would collect data about your app usage.
- **No Advertising Data**: Since we don't show ads, we don't collect any advertising-related data.

## How the App Works

QR Code Scanner operates entirely on your device:

- All QR code scanning is performed locally on your device
- Scanned data is processed only within the app
- No scanned content is transmitted to our servers or any third parties
- The app does not require an internet connection to function (except when you choose to visit URLs found in QR codes)

## Permissions We Request

The app may request the following permissions solely for functionality:

- **Camera Access**: Required to scan QR codes using your device's camera
- **Storage Access**: Only to save scanned results locally on your device if you choose to do so

These permissions are used only for the app's core functionality and no data is transmitted outside your device.

## Data Storage

- All app data is stored locally on your device
- We do not maintain any servers or databases that store your information
- If you uninstall the app, all associated data is removed from your device

## Third-Party Services

QR Code Scanner does not integrate with any third-party services for data collection or analytics. However, if a scanned QR code contains a URL and you choose to visit it, you will be subject to that website's privacy policy.

## Children's Privacy

Our app does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13. The app is safe for use by children as no data collection occurs.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## International Users

Since no data is collected or transmitted, there are no cross-border data transfer concerns.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect any personal data, traditional data protection rights (such as access, deletion, or portability) don't apply. However, you maintain complete control over the app by simply uninstalling it if desired.

## Contact Us
